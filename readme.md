📂 Text-to-Folder Structure Generator
A lightweight Python script that converts ASCII directory tree visualizations (like those generated by AI or the tree command) into actual file system directories and empty files.

Ideal for quickly scaffolding new projects, reproducing architecture from documentation, or setting up test environments.

✨ Features
Visual Parsing: Uses indentation and standard tree characters (│, ├──, └──) to determine nesting levels.

Zero Dependencies: Runs on standard Python 3.x libraries (os, re, pathlib).

Safe Execution: Checks if directories exist before creating them to prevent errors.

Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

🚀 Quick Start
1. Prerequisite
Ensure you have Python 3 installed:

Bash

python --version
2. Setup
Save the script as create_structure.py.

3. Usage
Open the script in your text editor.

Scroll to the bottom variable tree_structure.

Paste your desired folder tree between the triple quotes """.

Run the script:

Bash

python create_structure.py
📝 Syntax Rules
To ensure the generator distinguishes between files and folders correctly, follow these two rules:

1. Folders must end with /
The script looks for a trailing slash to identify directories.

✅ Correct: presets/ (Creates a folder)

❌ Incorrect: presets (Creates a file named "presets")

2. Indentation matters
The script calculates the parent-child relationship based on visual indentation. Ensure your tree looks aligned (monospaced fonts recommended).

💡 Example
Input (in script):

Plaintext

project_root/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils/
│       └── helpers.py
└── README.md
Output (File System):

project_root/ (Directory)

src/ (Directory)

main.py (Empty file)

utils/ (Directory)

helpers.py (Empty file)

README.md (Empty file)

🛠️ Customization
Change Output Location: By default, the script creates folders in the current working directory (.). To change this, modify the base_path argument in the __main__ block:

Python

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example: Create structure on Desktop
    generate_folder_structure(tree_structure, base_path="/Users/Name/Desktop")
